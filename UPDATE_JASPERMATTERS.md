- Your professional portfolio needs to replace it immediately

## Quick Manual Deployment (2 minutes)

### Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest - No Login Required)
1. Open https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the entire `/Users/matthewscott/Projects/portfolio-website` folder
3. Wait for upload (30 seconds)
4. Click "Claim this site"
5. Go to Site Settings â†’ Domain Management
6. Add custom domain: jaspermatters.com
7. Done! Site will update in 5-10 minutes

### Option 2: Netlify Dashboard (If you have login)
1. Login to https://app.netlify.com
2. Find the site connected to jaspermatters.com
3. Go to Deploys â†’ Drag and drop your site folder
4. Or use "Deploy settings" â†’ Link to Git repository

### Option 3: Command Line (Now that you're logged in)
```bash
# Link to existing site
npx netlify link

# Choose "Link this directory to an existing project"
# Select the project that has jaspermatters.com

# Then deploy
npx netlify deploy --prod --dir=.
```

## Files Ready for Deployment

All files are in: `/Users/matthewscott/Projects/portfolio-website/`

âœ… index.html - Main portfolio page

âœ… script.js - Interactive features

```
