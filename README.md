## 🗄️ Database Schema

The SQLite database tracks everything with temporal awareness:

```sql
entries (
  id, type, title, content, category, mood,
  created_at, target_date, completed_at,
  progress, status, likes, tags, media_url
)

rituals (
  id, week_of, gratitude, challenges, 
  excitement, mood_score, reflections
)

insights (
  id, period, period_date, top_themes,
  mood_average, goals_completed, memories_created
)
```

## 🎨 Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + SQLite
- **Frontend**: React + Vite
- **Database**: SQLite with temporal queries
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with Tailwind-like utilities
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## 💡 What Makes This Different

Unlike the original vision board that used localStorage:
1. **Real persistence** - SQLite database survives browser clears
2. **Temporal awareness** - Countdowns, deadlines, progress tracking
3. **History tracking** - Nothing gets lost, everything timestamped
4. **Query power** - Complex insights and pattern recognition
5. **Weekly rituals** - Proactive relationship maintenance
