# üö® URGENT FIX: Your DNS is Controlled by Netlify, NOT GoDaddy!

## The Problem
- **jaspermatters.com** uses Netlify DNS (nsone.net nameservers)
- This means GoDaddy CANNOT control your DNS records
- You must fix this in NETLIFY dashboard, not GoDaddy

## Two Options to Fix This

### Option 1: Fix in Netlify (FASTEST - Do This!)

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**
   - https://app.netlify.com
   - Login with your GitHub account

2. **Find the OurJourney site**
   - Look for site showing jaspermatters.com

3. **Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Domain Management**
   - You should see jaspermatters.com listed

4. **Trigger a Redeploy**
   - Go to Deploys tab
   - Click "Trigger Deploy" ‚Üí "Clear cache and deploy site"

5. **Check Build Settings**
   - Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
   - Make sure:
     - Base directory: (leave empty)
     - Build command: (leave empty)
     - Publish directory: `.` or `/`

### Option 2: Switch Back to GoDaddy DNS (Takes Longer)

1. **In GoDaddy (where you are now):**
   - Select "GoDaddy Nameservers (recommended)"
   - Click Save
   - This takes 24-48 hours to propagate

2. **After propagation, add in GoDaddy DNS:**
   - A record: @ ‚Üí 75.2.60.5
   - CNAME: www ‚Üí ourjourney.netlify.app

## What's Happening Right Now

Your nameservers are:
- dns1.p04.nsone.net (Netlify)
- dns2.p04.nsone.net (Netlify)
- dns3.p04.nsone.net (Netlify)
- dns4.p04.nsone.net (Netlify)

This means:
- ‚úÖ Netlify controls your DNS
- ‚úÖ Your portfolio is already deployed
- ‚ùå But Netlify is serving the OLD OurJourney site
- ‚ùå GoDaddy DNS settings don't matter right now

## IMMEDIATE ACTION (Do This Now!)

Since you're already in GoDaddy:

### Step 1: Keep Netlify DNS (Don't Change Nameservers)
- Click "Cancel" on the nameserver edit
- Keep using Netlify DNS

### Step 2: Go to Netlify
```bash
open https://app.netlify.com
```

### Step 3: In Netlify Dashboard
1. Find your site (OurJourney)
2. Go to "Deploys"
3. Click "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Clear cache and deploy site"
4. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 4: Verify
```bash
curl -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' https://jaspermatters.com | grep title
```

## Why This Happened

1. When you set up OurJourney on Netlify, you transferred DNS control to Netlify
2. The GitHub repo has been updated with portfolio
3. But Netlify is still serving cached/old build
4. Need to force Netlify to rebuild from latest GitHub code

## If Netlify Still Shows OurJourney After Rebuild

The issue might be Netlify is building from wrong branch or has build cache. Fix:

1. In Netlify ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
2. Clear build cache
3. Check branch is "main"
4. Redeploy

**DON'T CHANGE NAMESERVERS** unless you want to wait 24-48 hours. Fix in Netlify now!
