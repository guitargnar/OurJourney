# OurJourney Deployment Issues & Fixes

## üî¥ Critical Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Backend Using Wrong Database (SQLite instead of PostgreSQL)
**Problem:** Server.js was still importing from `database.js` (SQLite) instead of `database.postgres.js`
**Impact:** Backend would crash on Render because SQLite doesn't work in cloud
**Fix Applied:** 
- Created `server.postgres.js` with PostgreSQL-compatible queries
- Updated all SQL queries to use PostgreSQL syntax (`$1, $2` instead of `?`)
- Changed package.json to use `server.postgres.js`

### 2. Netlify Build Failing - Vite Not Found
**Problem:** NODE_ENV=production caused npm to skip devDependencies
**Impact:** Build failed because Vite wasn't installed
**Fix Applied:**
- Updated netlify.toml to use `NODE_ENV=development npm ci && npm run build`
- This forces installation of all dependencies including build tools

### 3. PORT Environment Variable Not Used
**Problem:** Server was hardcoded to port 3001
**Impact:** Render couldn't connect to the app
**Fix Applied:**
- Changed to `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001`

### 4. Missing Authentication Middleware
**Problem:** API routes were unprotected
**Impact:** Security vulnerability
**Fix Applied:**
- Added `requireAuth` middleware to all API routes
- Auth checks for Bearer token matching AUTH_PASSWORD

### 5. CORS Not Configured for Production
**Problem:** Frontend couldn't connect to backend due to CORS
**Impact:** API calls would fail
**Fix Applied:**
- Added proper CORS configuration using environment variables

## üìä Current Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Frontend (Netlify)
- **URL:** https://musical-caramel-01f843.netlify.app
- **Status:** Deployed and running
- **Build Command:** `NODE_ENV=development npm ci && npm run build`
- **Environment Variables:** VITE_API_URL configured

### ‚è≥ Backend (Render)
- **URL:** https://ourjourney-api.onrender.com
- **Status:** Redeploying with fixes (5-10 minutes)
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL connected
- **Environment Variables:** 
  - DATABASE_URL ‚úÖ
  - AUTH_PASSWORD ‚úÖ
  - NODE_ENV ‚úÖ
  - PORT ‚úÖ
  - CORS_ORIGIN ‚úÖ

## üîß Testing Commands

```bash
# Test frontend
curl -I https://musical-caramel-01f843.netlify.app

# Test backend health
curl https://ourjourney-api.onrender.com/api/health

# Test with authentication
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer sage2025" \
  https://ourjourney-api.onrender.com/api/entries

# Run automated tests
node test-deployment.js
```

## üìù Remaining Tasks

1. ‚úÖ Fix backend to use PostgreSQL
2. ‚úÖ Fix Netlify build process
3. ‚úÖ Add authentication
4. ‚è≥ Wait for Render to redeploy (5-10 min)
5. ‚è≥ Test full functionality
6. ‚è≥ Connect jaspermatters.com domain

## üö® Known Issues

### Free Tier Limitations
- **Render:** Backend sleeps after 15 min inactivity, 30-50 sec wake time
- **Supabase:** 500MB database limit (plenty for this app)
- **Netlify:** 100GB bandwidth/month (more than enough)

### Next Steps After Deployment
1. Test login with password `sage2025`
2. Create a test entry to verify database connection
3. Check custody schedule accuracy
4. Connect custom domain in Netlify dashboard

## üéØ Success Criteria
- [ ] Frontend loads at Netlify URL
- [ ] Backend responds to health check
- [ ] Login works with password
- [ ] Can create/view entries
- [ ] Custody schedule shows correct days
- [ ] Katie can access from her devices

## üí° Troubleshooting

If backend still doesn't work:
1. Check Render logs for specific error
2. Verify DATABASE_URL in Render environment variables
3. Ensure Supabase isn't blocking connections
4. Check if PORT is correctly set to 10000

If frontend can't connect to backend:
1. Check browser console for CORS errors
2. Verify VITE_API_URL is set in Netlify
3. Ensure backend is actually running
4. Check network tab for 401/502 errors
